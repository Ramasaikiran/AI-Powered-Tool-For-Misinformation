## Project Features

* **Article Analysis**: Submit an article URL or text and receive an AI-generated credibility score, analysis, and references.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Frontend**: TypeScript + React, powered by Vite
* **AI Backend**: Integrated with Google Gemini (via `GEMINI_API_KEY`) for natural language and image analysis
* **Routing / Pages**: Organized under `/pages`
* **Reusable Components**: Reside under `/components`
* **API Services**: Located in `/services` for handling Gemini API and client-side logic
